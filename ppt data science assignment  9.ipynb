    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the tradeoff between model complexity and generalization performance. The bias of a model is the error that arises from approximating a real-life problem with a simpler model. The variance of a model is the error that arises from approximating a real-life problem with a more complex model. The bias-variance tradeoff states that as you increase the complexity of your model, you will decrease its bias but increase its variance. Conversely, as you decrease the complexity of your model, you will increase its bias but decrease its variance. "
